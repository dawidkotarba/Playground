This is just a simple example of Spring-based app with AngularJS. Dev still in progress.

Tech stack:
- build: Gradle (wrapper commited)
- container: Spring MVC
- db: H2
- JPA: Hibernate with Querydsl
- server: embedded Tomcat (Spring Boot app)
- tests: TestNG (todo)

Front-end (todo):
- build: bower + bulp/grunt (todo)
- js: AngularJS
- css: Bootstrap + Less?
